# Cluster Dashboard

Custom dashboard for my Raspberry Pi homelab cluster.

## Purpose

This application is the monitor-friendly homepage for my homelab. It provides:

- a quick overview of cluster nodes
- a simple list of core services
- a clean UI that can eventually run in kiosk mode on an external display

## Current Phase

Version 1 is intentionally simple:

- frontend: vanilla HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- backend: placeholder only
- data source: static JSON config
- deployment: local development first, Kubernetes later

## Structure

```text
